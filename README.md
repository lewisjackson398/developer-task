Improvements to Bristol Motors

• Homepage needs more whitespace, the content is too close together.

• Web content needs to be wrapped inside of a container.

• The colour scheme needs to match the colours of the logo.

• Add a search bar to the navbar.

• Change the header background image on slide 2 and 3 as it looks pixelated and blurry.

• An optional implementation could be to make the slideshow automatically change every 10 seconds and include the option of manually clicking.
