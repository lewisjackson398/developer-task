Improvements to Bristol Motors

3 implementations suggested: 

• The colour scheme needs to match the colours of the logo.

• Add a search bar to the navbar.

• Make the slideshow automatically change every 5 or 10 seconds and include the option of manually clicking.

Additonal suggestions:

• Homepage needs more whitespace (the content is too close together).

• Web content could be wrapped inside of a container.

• Change the header background image on slide 2 and 3 as it looks pixelated and blurry.
